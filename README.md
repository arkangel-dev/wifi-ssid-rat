# WiFi-RAT
A this script will scan wifi networks contantly and search for a specific keyword from the SSIDs. If that keyword is found, it will assume the rest of the SSID is a command. For example: if the SSID is "AndroidAp 5035" the magic word will be AndroidAp. and 5035 will be a command. But be sure to change it to something that someone else is not broadcasting. like AndroidAp. Also don't make it obvious during an attack, like ImAHacker.

# Applications
This script can be in a part of a botnet. It can be used to broadcast commands to infected hosts without leaving any meaningful traces, You can also use it more effectively if you can broadcast off of a high gain antenna. You can also use a wifi spammer to broadcast APs more quickly. Or you can use it find you laptop or something. I'd personally use it for the former.
